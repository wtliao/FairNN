# FairNN
This code repo is for our work "FairNN Conjoint Learning of Fair Representations for Fair Decisions" that has been accepted by [DS 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02173).
This project is in the cooperation between Institut f√ºr Informationsverarbeitung ([TNT](http://www.tnt.uni-hannover.de/)), Leibniz University Hannover, Germany, and [L3S](https://www.l3s.de/en) research center Hannover, Germany.
The work is supported by BIAS (Bias and Discrimination in Big Data and Algorithmic Processing. Philosophical Assessments, Legal Dimensions, and Technical
Solutions) a project funded by the Volkswagen Foundation within the initiative AI and the Society of the Future for which the last authors are Principal Investigators.


## Data
Before running the code, please download the [adult](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult) and [bank](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing) dataset and put them under dictinoary.

## Pretrained models
the Pretrained model can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dvDxVjRkKfhD9xfgDyn5eBHo_KhDuM7f/view?usp=sharing)

## More
For convenience, we save the code into adult and bank folder for the utilization on the corresponding dataset seperately. Besides parameter settings, the codes are identical.
